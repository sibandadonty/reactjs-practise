# BEAT RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

## OVERVIEW

<ul>
  <li>A system used by music producers and rappers/singers</li>
  <li>Two types of users, producers and rappers</li>
</ul>

### Producers

<ul>
  <li>Producers upload music and their music is streamed</li>
  <li>They can get stats/feedback of their music such as how many listens per month etc</li>
  <li>Rappers will be able to buy producers' music</li>
  <li>For rappers who listen to a certain producer's music the most, that producer has the ability to message those rappers and maybe collaborate</li>
  <li><i>Producer's music will be recommended to rappers through <b><u>collaborative filtering</u></b></i></li>
  
</ul>

### Rappers

<ul>
  <li>Rappers can stream and buy beats</li>
  <li>If they love the beat that they are listening to, they are able to like that beat.  Note that this is crucial for collaborative filtering</li>
  <li>Rappers can talk to the producer that they listen to the most, given that the producer has messaged them first</li>
</ul>
